      <p>One of the criticisms of the experience curve is that it makes market leaders complacent with their achievements. By getting the benefits of experience curve effects, the companies become reluctant to continually innovate and lower the unit costs because of their experience.</p>
      <p>As a result, such companies become satisfied with their level of achievement. They begin resisting change, which may eliminate their cost benefits of the experience curve. Competitors that replicate the strategies and adopt the latest technologies will easily surpass the market leaders and achieve their own experience curve.</p>
      <p style="font-size:larger;font-weight:bold;color:#00483A;line-height: 2;">Inability to measure its effects</p>
      <p">Another criticism of the experience curve is the inability to measure its effects. Most of the time, its effects are closely related to economies of scale, and it will be impossible to differentiate between the two. Economies of scale are the cost benefits gained due to an increased level of production, whereas experience curve effects are the cost benefits achieved through experience by performing repetitive tasks.</p>
      <p>Both concepts are intertwined, and it is difficult to differentiate between experience and increased level of production. It makes it difficult to measure the cost benefits of each function.</p>
