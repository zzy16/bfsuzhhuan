      <p>Experience Curve is a concept that states that there is a consistent relationship between the cumulative production quantity of a company and the cost of production. The concept implies that the more experienced a company is in manufacturing a specific product, the lower its cost of production.
  
        When the total production capacity (from the first unit to the last) doubles, the value-added costs decline by a constant percentage. The value-added costs include the cost of manufacturing, marketing, distribution, and administration.
        
        When representing an experience curve on a graph, the cost per unit of production is plotted on the Y-axis, while the cumulative production quantity is plotted on the X-axis. The unit cost of production includes the cost incurred by the company to add value to the product but excludes the cost of purchasing the materials.
        
        The curve shows that as the company increases its overall cumulative production quantity, the unit costs decline at a constant rate. The decline goes on without limit and is surprisingly consistent, even from one industry to another. In some cases, the absence of experience in some industries may be viewed as an outcome of mismanagement.
        
        Based on the research conducted by BSG, we can deduce that the experience curve of lower unit costs tends to become stronger for large businesses that are market leaders in their respective industries.</p>
