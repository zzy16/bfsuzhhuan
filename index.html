  <div id="para"><p>The concept of experience curve was first introduced by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in the 1960s while analyzing cost behavior in companies. Bruce Henderson, the group’s founder, led a study into a leading manufacturer of semiconductors to analyze the relationship between cost behavior and production quantity. The research found that when the manufacturer doubled the volume of production, there was a 25% decline in the overall cost of manufacturing. Boston Consulting Group defined the relationship as “experience curve”, where a company gains more experience by producing more of a particular product. Additional research conducted by BCG in the late 1960s and early 1970s revealed that the experience curve effect for various industries ranged between 10% and 25%.
