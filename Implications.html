      <p>A company that benefits from the effects of an experience curve enjoys several advantages over its competitors. As the business grows and lowers its unit production costs, it will gain a bigger market share over its rivals. It means that it will control a bigger portion of the market, increasing its profit potential. Since the company enjoys cost advantages over competitors due to the reduced cost of production, it can develop a penetrative pricing strategy by setting a low price to attract more customers to purchase its products. Other strategies used to increase market share include increasing investment in marketing, production capacity, hiring more sales personnel, etc.</p>
      <p style="font-size:larger;font-weight:bold;color:#00483A;line-height: 2;">Cons</p>
      <p>On the downside, the experience curve can sometimes come to an abrupt end when the competitors discover the strategy and replicate the cost reductions without making huge capital investments to gain experience. The experience curve can also come to an end when new technologies are introduced, and the company will need to create a new curve. It must upgrade its processes by replacing the old experience curve with a new one that allows it to retain its competitive advantage.</p>
